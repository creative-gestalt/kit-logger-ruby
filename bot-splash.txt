this bot is used for logging kits. A few things to note:

(1)  The logger is centralized to one machine, contact @creativegestalt if something goes wrong.
(2)  Certain failures will be logged, but not sent to you.
(3)  If your logged kits is less than your selection, you ran out of member numbers during the session.
(4)  If you never receive results contact @creativegestalt

Commands:
/start
/qstart - skip this message.
/stop

First tell me what state you want to log.
